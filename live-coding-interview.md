# Live Coding Interview

Steps for Solving Algorithms Questions in Coding Interviews

1.  Explain your approach verbally on how to solve the question without code 
2.  Before your start writing the code ask the interviewer what should you return for edge cases (if input is null or input length is 0 these are edge cases)
3.  Give Meaningful Names to variables and functions you are using 
4.  Add Comments in your code where you think there is complex logic written 
5.  At the end dry run your code (Step by step go through your code with one example)
6.  Tell them the time and space complexity
