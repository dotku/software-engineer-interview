Algorithms
Merge Sort implementation.
Fibonacci Series: Solutions using recursion, memoization, and dynamic programming.
Quick Sort vs Merge Sort: Comparison based on performance and use cases.
LeetCode Problems: Examples such as valid triangle number, first unique character in a string, valid parentheses, pangram checking, kth largest element in an array.
1.	 Implement LRU(Least Recently Used) Cache
2.	Write a function to determine whether duplicate elements in a given array are within a given distance of each other.
3.	Write a recursive function to calculate the height of a binary tree in Java.
4.	Write Java code to count number of nodes in a binary tree
5.	Print Left view of any binary trees.
6.	Given an m x n 2D grid map of '1’s which represents land and '0’s that represents water return the number of islands (surrounded by water and formed by connecting adjacent lands in 2 directions - vertically or horizontally).
7.	What is topological sorting in a graph?
8.	Write a program to remove duplicates from a sorted array in place?
9.	Write a function for zigzag traversal in a binary tree
10.	Write a function to sort a linked list of 0s, 1s and 2s
11.	Write a function to detect cycle in an undirected graph
12.	Write a function to convert an infix expression to postfix expression
13.	Write a function to find the maximum for each and every contiguous subarray of size k.
14.	Write a function to merge two sorted binary search tree
15.	Write a function to print all unique rows of the given matrix.
16.	Write a function to find number of subarrays with product less than K
17.	Find the subsequence of length 3 with the highest product from a sequence of non-negative integers, with the elements in increasing order.
18.	Write a function to implement Quicksort on Doubly Linked List
19.	Write a function to connect nodes at the same level of a binary tree.
20.	Write a function to find number of structurally unique binary trees are possible


Steps for Solving Algorithms Questions in Coding Interviews

1.  Explain your approach verbally on how to solve the question without code 
2.  Before your start writing the code ask the interviewer what should you return for edge cases (if input is null or input length is 0 these are edge cases)
3.  Give Meaningful Names to variables and functions you are using 
4.  Add Comments in your code where you think there is complex logic written 
5.  At the end dry run your code (Step by step go through your code with one example)
6.  Tell them the time and space complexity 


React:
how to make a restapi call in react?
React Counter Application 
A counter variable which is a number value is displayed on the screen
2 Buttons + and - 
Clicking on + should increment the counter by 1
Clicking on - should decrement the counter by 1
At the start the counter is at 0 and it can go -ve or +ve
Question:

Given a 2 x 2 Grid where each square in the grid is clickable and when i click on any square it flips between X and O 
at the starting point every square has X as default value 

Shipping service component
4 input boxes -> 1 for weight, 3 for dimensions (height, length, breadth).
Functionality ->
Design a component in React to get input from the user and call an api to get service options
available to support the desired inputs (weight and dimensions)
The service options have to be displayed to the user in a group. The options should be
checkboxes selectable by the user. At max 4 items can be selected.

 Given data for food in an array of objects containing name, price and description, write a component to display them. When a user clicks one of the items, 
 it will be added to cart. If it is clicked multiple times, the count will be increased. Implemented a cart component to show the items added to cart like, 
 name, price and count and calculate and display the total price.


nodeJS:

How to make a rest api call in nodejs?
Scenario: You are tasked with building a RESTful API for managing a list of books. Each book has a title, author, and ISBN. Implement basic CRUD 
(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Express.js.
Scenario: Write a Node.js script that reads the contents of a directory, filters out only the .txt files, and prints their contents to the console.
Scenario: Implement a simple chat server using WebSockets. Users should be able to connect to the server and broadcast messages to all other connected users.
Scenario: Create a simple API to manage a list of users using MongoDB. Implement endpoints to add, retrieve, update, and delete users.
Scenario: Write a function that reads a file and logs its contents. Use Promises and async/await to handle asynchronous operations.
