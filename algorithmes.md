# Algorithms

Merge Sort implementation.
Fibonacci Series: Solutions using recursion, memoization, and dynamic programming.
Quick Sort vs Merge Sort: Comparison based on performance and use cases.
LeetCode Problems: Examples such as valid triangle number, first unique character in a string, valid parentheses, pangram checking, kth largest element in an array.
